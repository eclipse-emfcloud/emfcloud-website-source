Modeling features built with EMF.cloud can be integrated with VS Code, Eclipse Theia, or any arbitrary web application. Even the model management can be built for Node.js to operate as a service in the cloud, or bundled with webpack to run as a frontend-only browser app, making any need for a backend obsolete while still providing a full-fledged modeling tool.
