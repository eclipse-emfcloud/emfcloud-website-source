EMF.cloud is a flexible architecture of compatible libraries and components embedded in a rich ecosystem of well-established best-in-class open-source technologies inside and outside of the EMF.cloud project. To name a few of them, EMF.cloud is close friends and works well with Eclipse GLSP, JSON Forms, Langium, as well as EMF and Xtext.
