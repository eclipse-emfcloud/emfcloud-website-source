EMF.cloud is not a monolith, but a set of libraries designed to be customized. To accommodate different data formats, user interfaces, or even deployment scenarios, such as cloud backends vs. frontend-only browser apps, you can combine and adapt existing EMF.cloud components or replace certain parts with your custom code for your use case.
