EMF.cloud takes a very simple and pragmatic approach for defining the structure of your model data. For the usual cases, you just define Typescript interfaces and annotate them with meta-information, if necessary, and the rest is taken care of by the EMF.cloud tooling to create a model hub that is capable of managing data according to your model structure.
