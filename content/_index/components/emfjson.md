JSON binding for EMF models, that allows serialization and deserialization of EMF Resources in JSON. You can either change the file format to store your model instances or use the JSON serialiation to transfer model data, e.g. to a web client. The EMF-JSON mapper is used by the EMF.cloud model server, but can be used independantly, too.
