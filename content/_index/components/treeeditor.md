The EMF.cloud tree editor framework allows to efficiently build data-centric editors in Eclipse Theia. The framework provides all the basic requirements out-of-the-box so you only need to implement the domain-specific part, e.g. what icons to use, how the hierarchy of the tree is derived from the data or how the detail form is layouted.
