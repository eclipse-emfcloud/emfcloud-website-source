# Getting Started

EMF Cloud provides two approaches to best accommodate your project's needs. Choose the path that aligns best with your requirements.

## Model Hub Approach

Designed for projects that require robust, command-based model management with features like undo/redo, versioning, and persistence. This approach is best suited for users who need a tightly controlled model manipulation environment.

→ Explore the [Model Hub Demo](https://github.com/eclipse-emfcloud/modelhub/tree/main/examples/theia) for a practical example.

## Langium-Based DSL Approach

Tailored for projects that benefit from advanced textual DSL support with integrated Language Server Protocol (LSP) features, scaleable cross-reference and workspace indexing support. This approach excels in delivering a modeling solution for large interconnected models that are spread across many files, with full control over the underlying textual format.

→ Check out the [CrossModel Demo](https://github.com/CrossBreezeNL/crossmodel) to see this approach in action.

For a detailed comparison of the two approaches and guidance on when to use which, please refer to our [EMF Cloud Approaches Documentation](../approaches).

Get started by selecting the demo that best matches your project’s requirements.
